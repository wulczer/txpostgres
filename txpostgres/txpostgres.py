"""
txpostgres is a library for accessing a PostgreSQL_ database from the Twisted_
framework. It builds upon asynchronous features of the Psycopg_ database
library, which in turn exposes the asynchronous features of libpq_, the
PostgreSQL C library.

It requires a version of Psycopg that includes support for `asynchronous
connections`_ (versions 2.2.0 and later) and a reasonably recent Twisted (it
has been tested with Twisted 10.2 onward). Alternatively, psycopg2-ctypes_ can
be used in lieu of Psycopg.

txpostgres tries to present an interface that will be familiar to users of both
Twisted and Psycopg. It features a :class:`~txpostgres.Cursor` wrapper class
that mimics the interface of a Psycopg :psycopg:`cursor <cursor.html#cursor>`
but returns :d:`Deferred` objects. It also provides a
:class:`~txpostgres.Connection` class that is meant to be a drop-in replacement
for Twisted's :tm:`adbapi.Connection <enterprise.adbapi.Connection>` with some
small differences regarding connection establishing.

The main advantage of txpostgres over Twisted's built-in database support is
non-blocking connection building and complete lack of thread usage.

The library is distributed under the MIT License, see the LICENSE file for
details. You can contact the author, Jan Urba≈Ñski, at wulczer@wulczer.org. Feel
